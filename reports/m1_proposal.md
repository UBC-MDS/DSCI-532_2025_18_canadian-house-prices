## Motivation and Purpose:
Joel, an economist with a deep interest in real estate, is conducting a comprehensive analysis of the real estate market across Canada to uncover promising investment opportunities. His primary motivation is to identify cities with the highest potential for price appreciation, ensuring that investments made today can yield substantial profits through future resale or rental income.

Joel is analyzing various cities, comparing their real estate trends and market conditions. By examining fluctuations in city prices, he hopes to identify patterns from the data. The primary purpose of this analysis is twofold:
1. To provide Joel with a clear understanding of where the best investment opportunities lie.
2. To guide his decision-making process when acquiring properties in different cities that are likely to offer optimal financial returns.

## Description of the Data:

This dataset contains housing listing information for 45 major cities across Canada, providing insights into the real estate market in terms of property prices, demographics, and geographical data. The file is structured to allow in-depth analysis of housing trends in relation to city-specific features like population size, family income, and geographic location.

### Data Overview:

1. **Price Trends:** What are the overall trends in property prices across different cities?
2. **Outliers and Price Ranges:** What are the outliers in property prices, and what do the general price ranges look like for each city?
3. **Geographic Mapping:** How can properties be mapped based on their city locations, with color coding to represent property prices?
