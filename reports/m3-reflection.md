# Reflection on Canadian House Prices Dashboard (Milestone 3)

Since Milestone 2, our group has made significant progress in enhancing the Canadian House Prices Dashboard. Below, we outline the implemented features, deviations from the initial proposal, adherence to best practices, and plans for future improvements.

## Implemented Features

We’ve introduced several enhancements to improve functionality and usability:

- Added **GitHub** and **About** buttons to enhance navigation and accessibility.
- Relocated the project description under the **About** button for better organization.
- Streamlined the interface by removing the navigation bar and footer.
- Replaced "Filter" with the dashboard title for clarity.
- Simplified the layout for a cleaner user experience.
- Replaced the median price across cities bar chart with a **bubble chart** for a more engaging display of median prices.
- Enhanced bubble visibility in the bubble chart.
- Replaced the Plotly map with an **Altair map**, improving clarity and focusing on Canadian cities.

## Differences Compared to Initial Proposal / Sketch

Not all elements from the initial proposal were implemented as planned, and we made intentional deviations to prioritize usability:

- Removed the top bar to maximize screen space and ensure a cleaner layout.
- Repositioned the province dropdown above the city dropdown for improved user flow.
- Replaced the bar chart with a box plot (later transitioned to a bubble chart) to provide deeper insights into price distribution.
- Adjusted the map’s projection to Canada’s default, aligning with the project scope.
- Removed the property type distribution pie chart due to redundancy.

These changes reflect a shift toward a more intuitive and visually appealing design.

## Deviations from DSCI_531 Best Practices

We have attempted to adhere strictly to DSCI_531 best practices, ensuring effective visualizations and interactive elements that engage users.

## Current Strengths, Limitations, Challenging Part, and Future Improvements

### Strengths
- Interactive features allow users to explore data trends effectively.
- Simplified interface and Altair map improve usability and clarity.

### Limitations
- No significant limitations have been encountered so far.

### Challenging Part
- Inspired by group 30's dashboard, we implemented a loading effect to enhance the user experience during data retrieval, as Render.com can sometimes take up to a minute to load the dashboard and dataset.

### Future Improvements
- We plan to address additional feedback from Joel and our classmates to further refine the dashboard.

Overall, the dashboard is fully functional and user-friendly, with most proposed features implemented. We remain committed to refining these aspects to elevate the user experience in future iterations.
