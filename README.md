# Canadian House Prices Dashboard

Welcome to the **Canadian House Prices Dashboard**! This interactive tool provides insights into housing price trends across 49 major Canadian cities. Whether you're a homebuyer, investor, or policymaker, the dashboard allows for data exploration and informed decision-making.  

## Motivation and Purpose

The Canadian House Prices Dashboard was inspired by the need to simplify the exploration of Canadaâ€™s complex and dynamic real estate market, where housing prices vary significantly across regions. Traditional static reports often fall short of providing interactive, user-driven insights.

Our goal is to offer an accessible and intuitive tool, allowing users to filter and analyze housing data by key attributes such as province, city, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The dashboard integrates dynamic visualizations like bubble charts and Altair maps, transforming raw data into actionable knowledge. By making complex data more accessible, this tool empowers users to make informed decisions and explore emerging housing trends with curiosity.

## Project Overview

The dashboard allows users to:

- **Explore Data:** Filter data by city, price range, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, and other key variables.
- **Support Decision-Making:** Provide insights for homebuyers, investors, and policymakers.
